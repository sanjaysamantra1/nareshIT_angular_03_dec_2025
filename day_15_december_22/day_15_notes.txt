OOP
====
Class: BluePrint / structure / template to create objects
       no physical existance

Object: Physical entity / instance of a Class
        

in ES_5 , constructor function is used to create a Class
in ES_6 , we got class keyword


Prototype
=========
-a mechanism by which objects can inherit properties & methods from other objects.
-if value of a property/method remains same across objects, declare that property in prototype
-Every Javascript Object has a hidden property called [[prototype]], this prototype
 is another object from which it inherits properties and methods
-when we try to access a property:
    1. javascript looks for that property in the object itself
    2. if not found in object, it looks in its prototype
