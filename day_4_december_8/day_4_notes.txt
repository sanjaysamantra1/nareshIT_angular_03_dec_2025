Variables
=========
-in javascript variables can be declared by using eiteh of the below 3 keywords:
    1. var
    2. let
    3. const


    Var                            Let                            const
=================================================================================
1. Since Begining               1. ES_6 (2015)              1. ES_6  (2015)
2. value can be changed         2. value can be changed     2. value cann't be changed
3. not mandatory                3. not mandatory            3. initialization : mandatory
4. Function,global              4. block,function,global    4. block,function,global




Variable Scopes:
===============
1. Global : declared outside a function , can be accssed by any of the functions inside a subscriptions
2. Function : declared inside a function , can be accssed only inside that function
3. Block : declared inside a Block , can be accssed only inside that Block (if, else, loop)

Note : if a variable is declared without var/let/const , its scope is always 'global'
-It's not recommended to declare variables without var/let/const


Strict
======
Noraml : Few mistakes are ignored
Strict : mistakes are considered as errors
-'use strict' is used to enable strict mode
1. strict mode doesnt allow to declare variables without var/let/const
2. duplicate parameter not allowed
