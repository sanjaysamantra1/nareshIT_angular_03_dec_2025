How Javascript Code Gets Executed
=================================
-When a javascript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context(anonymous) is created
-For Every Function Call, a new Function Execution Context(f1,f2,f3) is Created
-Execution Context = Environment in which code gets executed
-Each Execution Context has 2 phases:
    1. Memory Creation Phase (memory gets allocated for variables and functions)
    2. Code Execution ( variables are initialized with actual value, functions are invoked)


Hoisting
========
-Its a mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope
-It allows to access only var type variables before initialization
-During memory phase though var/let/const everything is hoisted(present in memory),
 only var type variables are initialized with undefined value


Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
========================
-The state where variables are un-reachable 
-They are there in memory, but they are not usable
-let/const variables even though they are present in memory we cannt use them 
 as long as they are not initialized with actula values(10/20)
