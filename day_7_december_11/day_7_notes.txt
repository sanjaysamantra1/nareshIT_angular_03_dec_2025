User Defined functions
=======================
1. Function Declaration / named functions
2. Function Expression / anonymous
3. Self Invoked / IIFE-Immediately Invoked Function expression
4. Arrow Function


Self Invoked / IIFE
===================
-To invoke a function only once(during page load)
-to create block variables even by using 'var'
ex: (function(){
    // function Body
})();


Arrow Function (ES_6 - 2015)
==============
-concise syntax
-implicit return
-arrow function doesn't have it's own 'this'
-arrow function uses 'this' from lexical/outer scope
-'this' is static in arrow function
-best suited for as callback functions


Arrow Function Limitations
==========================
-Arrow Functions shouldn't be used as object literal methods
-Arrow functions shouldn't be used, if 'this' has to be dynamic
